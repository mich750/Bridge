Program created to play bridge with computer. It plays poorly but will be upgraded soon. To start the game run file main.py.

Program is written in Polish (actually only texts 'you won/lost' and 'deal again/exit' and functions' and variables' names) and if it's problem for you just contact me.

Most important information about computer's bidding system is: 1NT-2C is Stayman, 1NT-2D/2H/2S/3C are transfers to H/S/C/D, 1C-1D is negative, does not bid slams, and other responses are natural
